# SMJSON

This is a tool to convert single line JSONs to a multi-line JSON, and vice versa.

In Natural Language Processing, it is common to have a lot of documents saved in separate JSONs.
Saving them into one single file can greatly save IO time when loading the files.
It works well when the files are accessed only by machines but humans.
